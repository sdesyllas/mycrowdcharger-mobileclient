My crowd charger mobile client built in C# with Xamarin

# Project Description
Have you ever been in the position of having no battery in your latest technology smartphone?
Both finding a power outlet and a charger, or even a powerbank is usually difficult. Have you ever considered the option that a passer-by or a person sitting near you might not mind giving you a percentage of his/her smartphoneâ€™s energy in exchange of you doing the same for someone else who might be in your position in the future?
This thesis work depends on crowdsourcing and finding a sufficient number of peers to contribute to a network based on exchanging spare energy of mobile phones. This is mostly a mobile app project, however, the implementation depends also on the available hardware technology (wired or wireless battery energy transfer, mobile devices supporting such an option).

This is a Thesis project for University of Piraeus supervised by Lecturer Efthimios Alepis
